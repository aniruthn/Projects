# Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I was working on as I was first learning Python. Most of my newer projects can be found in separate repositories. I request that you not copy my code unless you reach out to me, but you are more than welcome to look through and explore.

Each project folder has all of the source code and references required to make the program run. Additionally, I have also uploaded pdfs of my thought process for some of the projects to explain the reasoning behind the code and the algorithm in a more accessible format.
