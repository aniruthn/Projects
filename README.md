# Projects
Hi. I'm Aniruth Narayanan and this is my GitHub page. I'll be uploading some of the projects that I think are kinda cool here as well as explanations to accompany them in the event that they are useful to anyone out there.
I request that you not copy my code unless you reach out to me, but you are more than welcome to look through and explore.

Each project folder has all of the source code and references required to make the program run. Additionally, I have also uploaded pdfs of my thought process for each project to explain the reasoning behind the code and the algorithm in a more accessible format.
