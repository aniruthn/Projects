# Projects
Hi. I'm Aniruth Narayanan and this is my GitHub page. I'll be uploading some of the projects that I think are kinda cool here as well as explanations to accompany them in the event that they are useful to anyone out there.
I request that you not copy my code unless you reach out to me, but you are more than welcome to look through and explore.
